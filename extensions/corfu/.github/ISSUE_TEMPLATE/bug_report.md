Thank you for reporting a bug.

Please use the latest stable release of Emacs 30.1 and start with `emacs -Q` or
`package-isolate` in order to only load a minimal set of packages. This way your
Emacs configuration is not loaded.

Please provide precise information and the exact steps to reproduce the issue.
This is important to ensure that your problem can be reproduced on a different
machine.

If you are not really sure if your issue is a bug, please open a discussion
instead.
